So you've decided to use Branon...

Here are some things to know:

- Branson is not an acronym.
- Branson requires MPI 1.10+, Boost (headers only), Metis and ParMetis
- The point of Branson is to study different algorithms for parallel
 Monte Carlo transport. Currently it contains particle passing and
 mesh passing methods for domain decomposition.
- Many of the parameters that impact parallel performance can be set in the
 input file.
- The input file format is ugly right now and I don't have a good list of
 parameters and what they do. Sorry.
- Input files are in XML, which makes them easy to generate and change in 
 python
- Input files are complicated when you want to have multiple spatial regions
 but are pretty simple otherwise.

Installing Branson:

- Branson uses CMake. The main CMakelist file is in the src directory
- There is only one cmake user option right now: "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE" which 
 can be set on the command line with "DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release" and
 the default is release.
- Visualization is optional and will be turned on if HDF5 and SILO libraries
found
